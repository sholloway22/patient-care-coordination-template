# Patient Care Coordination Template (Excel Project)

This Excel project simulates a simplified patient-care coordination system for a healthcare center.  
It demonstrates how Excel can be used to create lightweight relational data structures ‚Äî linking patient biodata with active treatment plans.

## üè• Project Overview
The workbook includes two connected sheets:
1. **Patient Biodata** ‚Äì Base table containing patient demographics and contact details.
2. **Patient Care Plan** ‚Äì Linked sheet for diagnoses, treatment plans, and provider assignments.

The sheets communicate through **data validation** and **XLOOKUP** functions to ensure all patient information stays consistent and accurate.

- Dropdown selection for **Patient IDs** drawn from the biodata sheet  
- **Automatic population** of First and Last Names using XLOOKUP  
- Columns for **Diagnosis**, **Treatment Plan**, **Start/End Dates**, and **Responsible Care Provider**  
- Easily expandable structure for additional fields such as follow-up dates, notes, or digital signatures

## üí° Why It Matters
In many healthcare settings, especially small clinics, Excel remains the first layer of digital data management.  
This project showcases how Excel can be used to enforce **data integrity, reduce manual entry errors, and simulate EHR-like logic** before migrating to full database systems.
